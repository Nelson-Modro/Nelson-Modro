# Welcome!
## I'm Nelson! A Senior .NET Software Engineer & Problem Solver 🚀

For over 30 years, I've been doing what I love: building software. I've led projects from the first line of code to the final user training, giving me a unique, end-to-end perspective on what makes a system truly successful.

My technical journey began in the foundational world of Mainframes with COBOL. I then transitioned to building powerful desktop applications with VB6, before evolving alongside the .NET Framework to master VB.NET, WPF, and now C#. Throughout this evolution, my work has consistently been supported by deep expertise in relational databases, primarily SQL Server, ensuring that every solution is built on a solid data foundation.

A developer's greatest skill is adaptability. I thrive on solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and focusing on what truly matters: **delivering results**.

I'm currently seeking a new challenge in a remote role where I can help a great team build amazing things.
